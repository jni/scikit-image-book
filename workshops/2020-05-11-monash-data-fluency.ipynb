Despite a deep appeal to human intuition, gaining understanding of image content remains challenging, and often relies on heuristics. Even so, the wealth of knowledge contained inside of images cannot be overstated, and <a href=\"http://scikit-image.org\">scikit-image</a>, along with <a href=\"http://scipy.org\">SciPy</a>, provides a strong foundation upon which to build algorithms and applications for exploring this domain.\n",
